# Griffeath-model
This cyclic cellular automaton is a kind of automaton rule invented by David Griffeath from University of Wisconsin â€“ Madison.

This auto-reproductive cell automaton is two-dimensional, and its cells can take four states (red, brown, purple, purple). 
The state of a cell at time t + 1 depends on its state at time t and the state of its 8 neighbors (Moore's neighborhood). 
A cell moves from a state i to a state i + 1 (mod 4) in the state cycle when the state i + 1 (mod 4) is present in at least three neighboring cells.
